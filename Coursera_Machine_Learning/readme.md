# Coursera: Machine Learning

Code, written during Coursera Machine Learning course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning .
Please, do not use that code and try to finish all homeworks by yourself.

During that course I've implemented some algorithms in Matlab, maybe they will be useful in future.
Also putted MatrixOperations.pdf, useful one.
